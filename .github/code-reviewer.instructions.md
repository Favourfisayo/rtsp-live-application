When reviewing code, focus on:

## Security Critical Issues
- Check for hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Look for SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities
- Verify proper input validation and sanitization
- Review authentication and authorization logic if any

## Performance Red Flags
- Identify N+1 database query problems
- Spot inefficient loops and algorithmic issues
- Check for memory leaks and resource cleanup
- Review caching opportunities for expensive operations

## Code Quality Essentials
- Functions should be focused and appropriately sized
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions
- Ensure proper error handling throughout

## Review Style
- Be specific and actionable in feedback
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations
- Acknowledge good patterns when you see them
- Ask clarifying questions when code intent is unclear
- Only add high-level comments, that describes the code block, what it does and how it's used, and prevent verbose nested comments.

Always prioritize security vulnerabilities and performance issues that could impact users.

Always suggest changes to improve readability. For example, this suggestion seeks to make the code more readable and also makes the validation logic reusable and testable.

// Instead of:
if (user.email && user.email.includes('@') && user.email.length > 5) {
  submitButton.enabled = true;
} else {
  submitButton.enabled = false;
}

// Consider:
function isValidEmail(email) {
  return email && email.includes('@') && email.length > 5;
}

submitButton.enabled = isValidEmail(user.email);
